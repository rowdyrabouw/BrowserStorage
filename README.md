# Browser Storage

This repository contains two applications, the client and the server.

Both require installing some node modules, so make sure you run `npm install` inside the `client` and `server` folders.

After that, you can start both by running `npm start` in their respective directories.

The client will run on [http://localhost:1234/](http://localhost:1234/) and the server on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
